# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This web app allows you to create recipes and upload to the site. It will create a list of the uploaded recipes with a name, type of cuisine, image, ingredients and preparation. It also allows you to delete each individual recipe.
